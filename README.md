fql>
```

### Aliases
The following aliases are available within the query:
```
:id           - App ID
:secret       - App Secret
:accessToken  - The access token generated by the app id and secret
:uid          - The UID supplied by the -u or --uid flag.
:me           - If the -U or --user flag was supplied then the value of this variable is the uid supplied by the -u or --uid flag
```

This is a convenience so you don't have to keep entering long bits of data over and over

There is tab completion too for the support query syntax. maybe i'll get completion for table names and fields too! 

You can leave the remote session by simply typing 'exit' or calling it as a function 'exit()'
